What I wish I did when implementing my 1-st commercial project in system integrator...

It was successful project. We did everything on time. The code was covered with unit tests, console utility was developed in order to test real requests to real devices, but...

### The problem

...we didn't have autotests and we didn't provide continuous integration. The information about with which concrete firmware our proxy library can communicate was fixed only in project documents but not in our build artefacts.
