One of the challenges to be a successful software engineer is to **keep working skills relevant to the demands of the industry**
and to keep abreast with the latest trends. On the other side the challenge is to be able to quickly apply the skills which were acquired in the past.

There is a tons of docs, examples and tutorials publically available, 
but in the context of specific task it always turns out that important details and nuances are hidden or not underlined.
That's why I prefer to have my own notes, reference demos and quick starting guides, which are not carbon copies of an official resources.

The purpose of this site is to express via some reference demos what I have done in real projects and also to make a retrospective analysis of my work.
